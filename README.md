# Open Ocean Buddy Locator

By bbtinkerer (<http://bb-tinkerer.blogspot.com/>)

## Description

Device to give the direction of your buddy in the open ocean for diving, fishing, kayaking, etc. Know the location of your buddy without having to radio him in and give you directions.

Uses the Sony Spresense along with an Arduino Nano. The Spresense takes care of GPS and controlling the radio and OLED display and communicates to the Nano serially. The Nano controls the NeoPixel ring and magetometer.

## Dependencies
Adafruit LSM303 library (<https://www.adafruit.com/product/1120>)

Adafruit NeoPixel libraries (<https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels>)

Adafruit OLED libraries (<https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/arduino-library-and-examples>)

## Configuration

Use the Arudino IDE to upload the code to the Spresense and the Nano.

To get the Adafruit SSD1306 drivers to compile when the Spresense board is selected in the Arduino IDE, you will need to comment out a few blocks in the Adafruit_SSD1306.cpp. Comment out the blocks HAVE_PORTREG in the begin function. Also, remove or rename the files Adafruit_SPITFT.cpp, Adafruit_SPITFT.h and Adafruit_SPITFT_Macros.h in the Adafruit_GFX_Library.
